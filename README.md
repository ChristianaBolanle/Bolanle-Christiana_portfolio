 ## [Online Fraud Detection: Project Overview](https://github.com/ChristianaBolanle/Bolanle-Christiana_portfolio)
 ### According to Infosecurity Magazine, fraud cost the entire economy ¬£3.2 trillion in 2018. For some businesses, fraud losses could account for more than 10% of total costs. Such huge losses motivate companies to seek out novel strategies for preventing, detecting, and eliminating fraud. Machine learning is now the most efficient technological method for preventing financial fraud and I was able to:
 - Perform exploratory data analysis in python.
- Perform feature engineering.
- Perform Model selection, training, and validation.
- Perform Model evaluation
- Give recommendations to Blossom Bank based on insights from data.
